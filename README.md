This project is a simple CRUD application where the user can create a note, update a note, read a note and delete a note.
To use the application simply copy the files in the same directory and open the index.html file in your browser. From
there the user will be able to use the application. The notes that the user creates will be saved into the users local storage.
This project was created using vanilla javascipt and using the DOM to manipulate the html and css.
